# PAD Dungeon Parser

This repository primarily serves the purpose of providing dungeon data to another of my projects, [PAD Material Calculator](https://github.com/ben-vonderhaar/PAD-Material-Calculator).  This information is 100% scraped from [PuzzleDragonX](http://www.puzzledragonx.com) and is not supplemented in any way.  If you would like to use this information without generating it yourself, the latest special dungeon information can be downloaded as JSON at this link:
